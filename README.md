# 🧾 KMS Case Study: SQL Analysis Project

**Capstone Project – Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) | The Incubator Hub**

This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based case study completed as part of my data analysis training at the **Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) Program**, delivered by **The Incubator Hub**. The project involved querying a structured sales dataset for a fictional company, **KMS**, to extract business-critical insights and generate actionable recommendations.

## 🧩 Business Scenario

KMS is a multi-region product and service provider that deals with customers across various segments. As a **Junior Data Analyst**, I was tasked with investigating their sales performance, shipping costs, customer profitability, and operational efficiency using SQL queries.

The analysis was carried out using a structured dataset that was imported into a MySQL database. It covered transactions from 2009 to 2012, with multiple dimensions such as region, product category, shipping mode, customer type, and profit.
